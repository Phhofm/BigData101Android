    <string name="intro_text">Welcome to Big Data 101. Here you will learn concerning the technological as well as the legal aspects of Big Data. We will also have a look at the new GDPR and how this will affect companies in switzerland, espacially the insurance companies. You will also learn in this part, why the GDPR is sometimes loosely formulated and why there are no simple guidelines and rules a company can implement in regareds to the GDPR, since sometimes the circumstances are way more complicated than one might think. Giving the GDPR such a strong force with high penalties if not kept can also be catastrophical.</string>
    <string name="technology_text">Lets first have a look at the definition of Big Data. Big Data simply describes a data set that is too large to be processes by commercial end-user components like laptops or mobile phones or home computers. This data might be generated by sensors which input a hughe amount of data continuously. Or it might also be that the database of your insurance company might have grown too big for just a home computer to process. Just look at the data that a service like facebook gathers and processes. And so forth. Some text here.</string>
